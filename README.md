### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

The static comp challenge is a time-boxed coding challenge meant to work that HTML/CSS muscle. :muscle: Building out comps that reflect the designer’s choice in layout, spacing, font, imagery, and color to the smallest detail is an industry requirement. This project is meant to simulate an at-bat with matching a comp as pixel perfect as possible.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)

1. Fork + clone down this repo
2. `cd` into the directory
3. Install the library dependencies with `npm install`
4. To verify that it is setup correctly, run `npm start` in your terminal. Go to `http://localhost:8080/` and you should see a page with the Turing logo image and a beautiful gradient background. If that's the case, you're good to go.
5. Enter `control + c` in your terminal to stop the server at any time.

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

Check out the finished [static web page](https://seth-way.github.io/dog-party/)!

.. and compare it to the provided comp. ![static comp](dog-party-spec.png)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)

This static comp was completed by a Turing student in the 10th week of study. It was timeblocked for a 4 hour maximum, but took roughly 2.5 hours to complete.

### Contributors:
[//]: <> (Who worked on this application? Link to their GitHubs.)

Built & deployed by [Seth Way](https://github.com/seth-way)

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)

The primary goal of this project was to reinforce clean, modular CSS while recreating an existic static comp.

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)

- The main challenge of this project was to strictly recreate the comp on a nearly pixel by pixel level. I'm proud of the result given the time restrictions. Also, the CSS is easy to read and could be quickly understood/updated by future coders if necessary.
